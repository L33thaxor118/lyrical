[Verse 1]
You find a wave and try to hold on for as long as you can
You made a mistake you'd like to erase and I understand
"What's left for you and me?" I ask that question rhetorically
Can't buy into astrology, and won't rely on the moon for anything

[Chorus]
No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back after what's been said
No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back

[Verse 2]
Meditate, play solitaire, take up self defense
When you get old and faded out, will you want your friends?
What's left for you and me? You respond to my question metaphorically
Don't read into psychology and won't rely on your mood for anything

[Chorus]
No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back after what was said
No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back after what's been said

[Verse 3]
You find a wave and try to hold on for as long as you can
You made a mistake you'd like to erase and I understand
What's next for you and me? I'll take suggestions
We toss and turn in undertow, time to let go

[Outro]
There's no turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back after what's transpired
No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back, it's so uninspired
No turning, there's no turning
There's no turning back, no turning back
